Define tests in a tests.def file with format :
Title on one line followed by
Invocation string on one line

Do NOT put extra newlines at end of file.

Then run 
./collect_data.pl < tests.def
Which will build the "expected output" data files.
These are typically commited to svn.

To evaluate the actual tests run
run_all.sh

NB : the syntax of the output is adapted to please teamcity continuous integration server.
