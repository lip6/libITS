To run the benchmarks on all the models in newTests/.


1.  Generate a newTests.mk Makefile with

    ./genmk.sh newTests


2.  Build log files for all models with

    make -f newTests.mk

    (Use make -j2 -f newTests.mk if you have a dualcore with a lot of
    memory.)


3a.  Calculate statistics with

    ./sum.pl newTests/**/*.log

    If you want to filter on a method, use

      ./sum.pl -f '^SLAP' newTests/**/*.log

    to filter on a model, use

      ./sum.pl -f 'ring' newTests/**/*.log

    to filter on a method and a model, use

      ./sum.pl -f '^SOG.*ring' newTests/**/*.log

3b.  Alternatively, generate scatter graphs to compare two techniques

     ./graph.sh sog-dsog-ticks.eps SOG DSOG 5 newTests/**/*.log

     where:
     - sog-dsog-ticks.eps is the name of the output file,
     - SOG and DSOG are the name of the two techniques to compare
     - 5 is the number of the column of the test output you want to plot
         (Column 5 in is the number of ticks.)
