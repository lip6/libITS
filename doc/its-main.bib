@book{milner99picalculus,
    Abstract = {{Communication is a fundamental and integral part of computing, whether between different computers on a network, or between components within a single computer. In this book Robin Milner introduces a new way of modelling communication that reflects its position. He treats computers and their programs as themselves built from communicating parts, rather than adding communication as an extra level of activity. Everything is introduced by means of examples, such as mobile phones, job schedualers, vending machines, data structures, and the objects of object-oriented programming. But the aim of the book is to develop a theory, the pi-calculus, in which these things can be treated rigorously.   The pi-calculus differs from other models of communicating behaviour mainly in its treatment of mobility. The movement of a piece of data inside a computer program is treated exactly the same as the transfer of a message--or indeed an entire computer program--across the internet. One can also describe networks which reconfigure themselves.  The calculus is very simple but powerful; its most prominent ingredient is the notion of a name. Its theory has two important ingredients: the concept of behavioural (or observational) equivalence, and the use of a new theory of types to classify patterns of interactive behaviour. The internet, and its communication protocols, fall within the scope of the theory just as much as computer programs, data structures, algorithms and programming languages.   This book is the first textbook on the subject; it has been long-awaited by professionals and will be welcome by them, and their students.}},

    Abstract = {UML provides several kinds of diagrams to model the behavior and structure of a system under development. A consistency problem may arise due to the fact that some aspects of the model may be described by more than one diagram. Hence, it is important that the consistency of the system description should be checked before implementing it. This paper describes an algorithmic approach to a consistency check between UML Sequence and State diagrams. The algorithm we provide also handles complex State diagrams, e.g. diagrams that include forks, joins, and concurrent composite states. We describe the algorithm in detail, and elaborate on the design decisions made while developing the algorithm. We have implemented BVUML, a tool that assists in automating the validation process.},

@article{MingsongChen08252007,
    Abstract = {Test case generation based on design specifications is an important part of testing processes. In this paper, Unified Modeling Language activity diagrams are used as design specifications. By setting up several test adequacy criteria with respect to activity diagrams, an automatic approach is presented to generate test cases for Java programs. Instead of directly deriving test cases from activity diagrams, this approach selects test cases from a set of randomly generated ones according to a given test adequacy criterion. In the approach, we first instrument a Java program under testing according to its activity diagram model, and randomly generate abundant test cases for the program. Then, by running the instrumented program we obtain the corresponding program execution traces. Finally, by matching these traces with the behavior of the activity diagram, a reduced set of test cases are selected according to the given test adequacy criterion. This approach can also be used to check the consistency between the program execution traces and the behavior of activity diagrams.

    Abstract = {The article presents a novel control-flow based test sequence generation technique using UML 2.0 activity diagram, which is a behavioral type of UML diagram. Like other model-based techniques, this technique can be used in the earlier phases of the development process owing to the availability of the design models of the system. The activity diagram model is seamlessly converted into a colored Petri net. We proposed a technique that enables the automatic generation of test sequences according to a given coverage criteria from the execution of the colored Petri nets model. Two types of structural coverage criteria for AD based models, namely sequential and concurrent coverage are described. The proposed technique was applied to an example to demonstrate its feasibility and the generated test sequences were evaluated against selected coverage criteria. This technique can potentially be adapted to service oriented applications, workflows, and concurrent applications.},

The goal is to use the configurable graphic interface and the mathematical analysis methods of the Petri net to verify the logic correctness of the flow control mechanism and then apply the standard modeling and implementation capabilities of UML to transform the control specifications into desired computer codes with specified logic and configuration. The proposed design methodology was demonstrated by modeling and analyzing objects and scenarios developed for the control module used in intelligent manufacturing systems.},

    Abstract = {To aid the development of high quality software applications, we present an approach for consistency checking of UML dynamic models based on Petri net techniques. ECPN, an extended colored Petri net, is used to formally describe state transitions of individual objects and interactions among objects, and is therefore capable of verifying the consistency of the models based on Petri net theory. In this work, we consider UML sequence diagrams and statecharts. The approach begins with a flattening strategy for UML dynamic models and then discusses translation of statecharts with composite states to an ECPN notation. The coverability graph is used to drive the consistency checking process. The paper discusses all phases of the approach and illustrates the concept by an example},

@inproceedings{Robert-G.-Pettit:2006td,
    Abstract = {Object-oriented software development practices are being rapidly adopted within increasingly complex systems, including reactive, real-time and concurrent system applications. While data modeling is performed very well under current object-oriented development practices, behavioral modeling necessary to capture critical information in real-time, reactive, and concurrent systems is often lacking. Addressing this deficiency, we offer an approach for modeling and analyzing concurrent object-oriented software designs through the use of behavioral design patterns, allowing us to map stereotyped UML objects to colored Petri net (CPN) representations in the form of reusable templates. The resulting CPNs are then used to model and analyze behavioral properties of the software architecture, applying the results of the analysis to the original software design. },

    Abstract = {The emergence of the UML as a de facto standard for
                  object-oriented modeling has been mirrored by the
                  success of the B method as a practically useful
                  formal modeling technique. The two notations have
                  much to offer each other. The UML provides an
                  accessible visualization of models facilitating
                  communication of ideas but lacks formal precise
                  semantics. B, on the other hand, has the precision
                  to support animation and rigorous verification but
                  requires significant effort in training to overcome
                  the mathematical barrier that many practitioners
                  perceive. We utilize a derivation of the B notation
                  as an action and constraint language for the UML and
                  define the semantics of UML entities via a
                  translation into B. Through the UML-B profile we
                  provide specializations of UML entities to support
                  model refinement. The result is a formally precise
                  variant of UML that can be used for refinement
                  based, object-oriented behavioral modeling. The
                  design of UML-B has been guided by industrial
                  applications.  },

    Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the foundations of the run-time semantics underlying the Unified Modeling Language as defined in revision 2.0 of the official OMG standard. One of the problems with the format used for that standard is that the information relating to semantics is scattered throughout the text making it difficult to obtain a global understanding of how the various fragments fit together. This has led many to incorrectly conclude that UML has little or no semantic content. One of the objectives of this paper is to provide a clear and concise description of the structure and essential content of UML run-time semantics. This can serve as a convenient starting point for researchers who want to work on the problem of UML semantics and, in particular, those who are interested in producing formal models of those semantics.},

    Abstract = {Bounded reachability or model checking is widely believed to work poorly when using decision diagrams instead of SAT procedures. Recent research suggests this to be untrue with regards to synchronous systems, particularly digital circuits. This paper shows that the belief is also a myth for asynchronous systems, such as models specified by Petri nets. We propose Bounded Saturation, a new algorithm to compute bounded state spaces using Multi-way Decision Diagrams (MDDs). This is based on the established Saturation algorithm which benefits from a non-standard search strategy that is very different from breadth-first search. To bound Saturation, we employ Edge-Valued MDDs and rework its search strategy. Experimental results show that our algorithm often, but not always, compares favorably against two SAT-based approaches advocated in the literature for deadlock checking in Petri nets. },

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving such verification conditions, based on an automatic abstraction-checking-refinement framework that exploits natural abstraction boundaries present in software.

    Abstract = {In automatic software verification, we have observed a theoretical convergence of model checking and program analysis. In practice, however, model checkers are still mostly concerned with precision, e.g., the removal of spurious counterexamples; for this purpose they build and refine reachability trees. Lattice-based program analyzers, on the other hand, are primarily concerned with efficiency. We designed an algorithm and built a tool that can be configured to perform not only a purely tree-based or a purely lattice-based analysis, but offers many intermediate settings that have not been evaluated before. The algorithm and tool take one or more abstract interpreters, such as a predicate abstraction and a shape analysis, and configure their execution and interaction using several parameters. Our experiments show that such customization may lead to dramatic improvements in the precision-efficiency spectrum. },

@article{Huth:2007bq,
    Abstract = {Abstract~~Model checking is a particular approach to property verification of systems. One describes a system in a mathematical model, expresses the properties one wishes to verify for the system in a formal language, and then checks whether the model satisfies the formal property. Invented 25&nbsp;years ago, this approach is fully automatic and has therefore gained wide acceptance and is increasingly being used in commercial research and development units. Impediments remain on the road to successful technology transfer. For one, the size of models often increases exponentially in the number of variables or sub-models, preventing scalable automation. Abstracting a model to reduce its size can be a cost-effective way of addressing this. For another, systems and models may be subject to change, e.g. in an incremental design process. One then seeks cost-effective means of ascertaining that property verifications remain to be valid as models evolve. This special section presents current research on such abstraction and change management of model checking. },

labeled transitions. The transition labels represent actions. We give a semantics for such
nets in terms of transition systems. This allows us to describe and verify properties like
soundness: preservation of the option to terminate successfully. We describe the composition
of complex WF nets from simpler ones by means of operators: renement, sequencing, choice,
free merge, iteration, synchronous and asynchronous communication. These operators (except
the communication operators) preserve soundness, giving correctness by design. A strategy
for verication other properties is described.

    Abstract = {Generating the reachability set is one of the most commonly required step when analyzing the logical or stochastic behavior of a system modeled with Petri nets. Traditional ``explicit''algorithms that explore the reachability graph of a Petri net require memory and time at least proportional to the number of reachable markings, thus they are applicable only to fairly small systems in practice. Symbolic ``implicit''algorithms, typically implemented using binary decision diagrams, have been successfully employed in much larger systems, but much of the work to date is based on breadth-first search techniques best suited for synchronous hardware verification. Here, instead, we describe recently-introduced data structures and algorithms particularly targeted to Petri nets and similar asynchronous models, and show why they are enormously more efficient for this application. We conclude with some directions for future research.},

    Abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for generating state spaces of asynchronous systems using Multi-valued Decision Diagrams. In contrast to related work, we encode the next-state function of a system not as a single Boolean function, but as cross-products of integer functions. This permits the application of various iteration strategies to build a system's state space. In particular, we introduce a new elegant strategy, called saturation, and implement it in the tool SMART. On top of usually performing several orders of magnitude faster than existing BDD-based state-space generators, our algorithm's required peak memory is often close to the final memory needed for storing the overall state space.},

BDD give good results for synchronous systems, particularly for circuits that are well adapted to a binary encoding of a state. However both the operation definition mechanism (using more BDD) and the state representation (purely linear traversal from root to leaves) show their limits when trying to tackle globally asynchronous and typed specifications. Data Decision Diagrams (DDD) {$[$}7{$]$} are a directed acyclic graph structure that manipulates(a priori unbounded) integer domain variables, and which offers a flexible and compositional definition of operations through inductive homomorphisms.},
