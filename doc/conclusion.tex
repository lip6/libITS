\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have defined Instantiable Petri Nets, a formalism
that can be seen as an abbreviation of standard Petri nets, and that 
builds upon the concepts of \emph{type and instance} and a composition
 mechanism exclusively based on \emph{transition synchronization}.

We have shown how the modular and compositional definition of the
model can be exploited to improve model-checking algorithms, through
an example based on a symbolic model-checker that uses Hierachical Set
 Decision Diagrams to represent a state space.
